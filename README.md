# Pomodoro-Productivity
Android application that simulates the Pomodoro technique, with a reward system.
Has a simulated shop system, that allows the buying of time based rewards. The currency is points, earned by completing work cycles.
The user is rewarded with a long break when they have completed 4 work cycles. The idea behind this project is to promote productivity, when working on isolated tasks.
This application was solely programmed by Abdeali Daginawala, as his first Android application and can be downloaded from the following link: http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~adaginaw/pomodoro/
